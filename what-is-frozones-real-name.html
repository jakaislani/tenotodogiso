Singleton Jr. in Rise of the Underminer, and John Eric Bentley in Lego The Incredibles) is a long-time friend of the Parr family.</span></span><h2>Is Frozone's wife name Honey?</h2>Honey Best is Lucius Best's (a.k.a. Frozone) wife in The Incredibles and Incredibles 2.<h2>Is Violet Parr adopted?</h2>According to the popular Incredibles theory, Violet Parr is actually Edna Mode's daughter. The movies do not indicate that Violet is adopted, but viewers don't have to do more than look at Violet alongside the rest of the Parr family to notice the differences.<h2>Is Frozone's wife a super?</h2>She is the wife of Lucius Best (a.k.a. Frozone). While she never appears onscreen, she is mentioned early in the film by Helen, and later has a conversation with her husband. It is unknown if she is also a superhero, or just a normal citizen of Metroville.<h2>What is Elastigirl's last name?</h2>The world's most Incredible family is back!<p>Helen Parr, known in the Super world as Elastigirl, hung up her supersuit to raise the family with husband Bob, leaving their crime-fighting days behind them.</p><h2>Incredibles 2 - Best of Frozone</h2><p></p><h2>What is Helen Parr's maiden name?</h2>Helen Parr (née Truax), also known as Elastigirl and Mrs. Incredible, is the deuteragonist of The Incredibles and the protagonist of Incredibles 2.<h2>Is Jack-Jack a boy or girl?</h2>John "Jack-Jack" Jackson Parr (born c. 1961) is one of the supporting characters in The Incredibles and one of the major characters in its sequel. He is the youngest son of Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl and the younger brother of Violet Parr and Dash Parr.<h2>Does Frozone have a kid?</h2>Frozone and Honey eventually fell in love and got married. They had three children: Ember, Tyson and Brooke, all of whom have their own unique set of superheroes.<h2>What does Frozone say to wife?</h2>Frozone: “You tell me where my suit is woman ! This is for the greater good !” Honey: “I am your *wife* ! I am the greatest 'good' you are *ever* gonna get !”<h2>Will there be an Incredibles 3?</h2>However, the first Incredibles film arrived in 2004, while the second one was released in 2018. Disney Pixar The Incredibles 3 will premiere on October 22, 2022. You don't just mean it, we're talking about a time when the Incredibles would be taking place and you're not Mr. Incredible!<h2>How old is Edna?</h2>Edna is the protagonist of the novel, and the “awakening” to which the title refers is hers. The twenty-eight-year-old wife of a New Orleans businessman, Edna suddenly finds herself dissatisfied with her marriage and the limited, conservative lifestyle that it allows.<h2>What are Frozone's powers?</h2>Similar to the Marvel Comics superhero Iceman, Frozone has the power to freeze water, or even ambient moisture in the air. He is limited by the amount of water available, either in liquid form, or in the air.<h2>Was Honey a super?</h2>According to Bird, a Honey character was actually designed for the movie, but when the decision was made to keep her off-screen, she was repurposed into a brand new super.<h2>How did Frozone get his powers?</h2>Best discovered his powers when he was "one-and-a-half or two years old" when he froze a glass of Kool-Aid to make a popsicle. At some point after this, he adopted the persona of Frozone.<h2>Is Samuel L Jackson Frozone?</h2>Jackson lent his talents to another superhero universe. As the voice of Frozone in Pixar's The Incredibles, Jackson's familiar voice provided scene-stealing comic relief, bringing to life the super-powered Parr family's best friend and partner in crimefighting.<h2>Will there be a Frozone movie?</h2>Frozone is an American CGI-animated action-adventure-comedy superhero film, serving as a prequel to The Incredibles, being directed by Jordan Peele. It is produced by Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Pictures and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, being released on TBD.<h2>Does Frozone need to drink water?</h2>He can generate ice from his fingertips but is limited by the amount of moisture in the air and his body. He has made water and milk solid and can freeze bullets in midair while congealing gun-wielding opponents.<h2>Was Frozone in the military?</h2>Army. Frozone is a Captain in the Ninjago/SG1/Incredibles Army.<h2>Can Jack Jacks fly?</h2>Jack-Jack can seemingly make himself weightless and kind of floats around uncontrollably. It's not really flight, more just a zero-g float.<h2>How tall is Edna?</h2>Edna is a short woman with short black hair, brown eyes, a bulbous nose and round glasses. She is about 4'3" tall.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lmah6p77Os6annaNiv6aty2almqWV</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-addison-leaving-quantum-leap-new-partner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Addison Leaving Quantum Leap?
