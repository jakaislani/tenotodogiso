They haven't acted on their feelings as of the second season finale, but there's no shortage of reasons why <b>JJ and Kiara are meant to be together.</b></span></span><h2>Will Kie and JJ get together?</h2>So we were immediately open to it, because it seems like an interesting idea to explore but we kind of left it for season 3. So, that's not a full-throated yes that a Kie and JJ romance is definitively on it's way, but it's not out of the realm of possibility either.<h2>Does Kiara get with Pope or JJ?</h2>Kiara Breaks Up With Pope<p>Toward the end of Outer Banks season 1, Pope tells Kiara he loves her, which she doesn't know how to take until she kisses him in the season finale. While this set up the duo for a season 2 romance, it was never quite convincing that Kiara wanted to be with him.</p><h2>Do Kiara and JJ kiss?</h2>But it's important to note that before she kisses him, she glances over at JJ. Was it to see if he was asleep, or was it to make sure he wouldn't see the kiss? We might never know. Despite Kie checking on JJ, he does see the kiss.<h2>Do Kie and JJ date in season 3?</h2>While that never happened, it now looks like Outer Banks season 3 will finally be giving the JJ/Kie shippers everything they've ever wanted. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Jonas Pate, Josh Pate and Shannon Burke revealed that JJ and Kiara's relationship will be explored in more detail in season 3.<h2>OUTER BANKS: Cast on Kiara and JJ’s Future and Season 3 | Full Interview</h2><p></p><h2>Who is JJ dating in Outer Banks?</h2>Rudy Pankow plays JJ in Outer Banks, who seems to have feelings for Kiara in season 2. But in reality, Pankow is dating Outer Banks crew member Elaine Siemek. Fans first noticed Pankow's relationship in a since-deleted Instagram post from November 2020 with the caption: “You give me butterflies every day… literally.”<h2>Do JJ and Kie kiss in season 2?</h2>She didn't return his love for her. For an unexplained reason, she later kisses him, putting the two on the path to a relationship in season 2. But, the pairing wasn't the ship that took off like a rocket for Kie in the Outer Banks fandom.<h2>What happens to JJ in Outer Banks?</h2>During the Pogues' attempt to re-take their treasure from a freight ship occupied by the Cameron family, JJ was hit in the head and shoved into the water.<h2>Does Kiara get sent away?</h2>Kiara will temporarily get sent away<p>When the crew finally makes their way back from the island that they found themselves stranded on in the finale, Kiara's days in Outer Banks will most definitely be limited. But because she's one of the main characters, she'll certainly be back before long.</p><h2>Does JJ like Kiara season 2?</h2>Although it's filled with different romances, JJ and Kiara could be considered the best ship in Outer Banks. They haven't acted on their feelings as of the second season finale, but there's no shortage of reasons why JJ and Kiara are meant to be together.<h2>Who did Kiara sleep with in Outer Banks?</h2>Enjoying a brief respite once the Pogues were all firmly reunited, that connection was taken to the next level when Pope and Kiara slept together in Outer Banks season 2, episode 4, "Homecoming." What followed was a whole lot of awkwardness as Pope and Kiara navigated their new status quo.<h2>Is JJ in season 2 of Outer Banks?</h2>The 'Outer Banks' Season 2 Scene That Established JJ As The Best Pogue | Decider.<h2>Is Kiara's father a Pogue?</h2>Biography. Kiara is the only child of Mike and Anna Carrera. Her mother Anna was born into money and is from Figure Eight, while her father Mike rose from a less privileged Pogue background to start a very successful local restaurant called The Wreck (where Kie works for her parents).<h2>Who ends up together in Outer Banks?</h2>The short answer is yes, John B and Sarah do end up together by the end of Outer Banks season 2.<h2>Is JJ's dad abusive?</h2>9 JJ Lived In An Abusive Household<p>To start, JJ lived in an abusive household with his dad. His dad lived a hard life surrounded by drugs and alcohol, and it affected JJ.</p><h2>Does JJ get killed in Outer Banks?</h2>It's touch and go for a moment with Kie slapping on his chest and begging for him to wake up but thankfully JJ does. He survives season 2, and he has a potential surf trip booked with Kie if the Pogues are ever able to cash in on the two treasures they've found.<h2>Are JJ and Sarah half siblings?</h2>"The whole thing behind it is that JJ and Sarah's mom was having an affair with Ward or Luke, and either because Ward was greedy or Luke has addiction issues, she just left," Cline told Fallon. Yep, that means JJ and Sarah would technically be half-siblings.<h2>What is JJ's full name in Outer Banks?</h2>JJ Maybank is one of the main characters in Outer Banks. He is portrayed by Rudy Pankow.<h2>What episode does Kiara and Pope kiss?</h2>Initially his declaration of love for his best friend was rejected but in the season 1 finale, Kiara kissed Pope which completely changed the romantic game for the two.<h2>Who does JJ date in real life?</h2>Right now, some reports say Rudy Pankow, who plays JJ, is single. But, he's actually in a relationship with Elaine Siemek. The pair reportedly met on the set of Outer Banks, where Elaine was working as an assistant director.<h2>Is Kiara A Pogue or kook?</h2>John B is the lead character of the Netflix series Outer Banks. The first few episodes of the series introduce viewers to the lifestyle he and his friends lead as Pogues. His best friend is Kiara, a Kook by birth, Pogue by choice.<h2>How does season 2 Outer Banks end?</h2>Unfortunately, Rafe gets super-strength from all the adrenaline, and he's able to grab the rope and hold on to the Cross, until the crew can help him pull it back onto the ship. So the Camerons have the Cross and the sunken gold as the Pogues escape from their ship.<h2>Is Pope a Pogue?</h2>As John B, JJ and Pope come from working-class, lower-income families on the island, they are considered Pogues. Kiara and Sarah Cameron have become honorary Pogues, along with Cleo at the end of Outer Banks season 2.<h2>Did JJ take his dad's pills?</h2>He sends his dad off, who claims he's going to Yucatan, Mexico, and we see that JJ secretly took the pills from his dad. JJ and Luke's relationship isn't a major part of Outer Banks compared to everything else going on, but it's very important to JJ's character.<h2>Do pope and Kiara break up?</h2>While facing impossible odds, Kie (played by Madison Bailey) and Pope's (Jonathan Daviss) relatively new relationship began to fall apart and fans were incredibly annoyed at how the two characters were explored.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OonKxlm56us62MoJytZaeewal5yaM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./garrett-miller.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Garrett Miller- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Career">&larr;
