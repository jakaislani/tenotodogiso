Let’s know where is Stephanie Waldref going after leaving KOLD?</span></strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Stephanie Waldref is a well-known meteorologist best known for her appearance in the KOLD/KMSB. But she has been in the media talk after Stephanie revealed she is leaving the network.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Waldref served in the station as a morning meteorologist at KOLD News 13. She worked with the news station for more than four years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Previously she worked on the Beach in Wilmington, North Carolina. She stated that she had an incredible journey at the Beach and found working there beautiful.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Waldref has contributed to the vocation since the beginning of her initial career. She completed her higher-level education and started covering cold, harsh winters in her home state at the NBC affiliate in Minot.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Where Is Stephanie Waldref Going After Leaving KOLD?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Stephanie Waldref has become the fan concerned as she is set to leave the KOLD. She has announced her departure from KOLD through a Facebook post.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Stephanie&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>said</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, “I’ve never been one to sugarcoat things or beat around the bush, so here it goes: my last day on KOLD News 13 Live This Morning, FOX11 Daybreak, and 13 News Live at nine will be February 28.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She added, Wow, I never thought I would type those words out. I guess it’s really real now. So as soon as the Meteorologist shared her departure news online, people began to ask where is she going and about her further plans.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ss-1.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Unfortunately, she has yet to mention her further plans and if she is continuing in the same field or seeking better opportunities.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As we all know, she has been active in the field for long years, so Stephanie might be taking a break from her professional career to give more time to her family.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>See more:&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Where Is Dermot Murnaghan Going After Leaving Sky News? Is He Retiring?</span></a></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Anything could be a reason, as there are no specific details about her plans, which made us think w might see Stephanie in other shows.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Stephanie Waldref Husband, David Schoonhoven, And Kids</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Stephanie Waldref is happily married to her husband, David Schoonhoven. The couple got married on April 21, 2018.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, the wedding ceremony occurred at Wilmington’s ST Thomas Preservation Hall. Their close friends and families attended the ceremony.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Further, the lovely birds currently live in Tucson, Arizona. David works as a Fastanela, and together, the couple has a daughter who was ten months old three days ago.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/278934836_1505688346496068_8116596914811063974_n.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Waldref and David welcomed their daughter on April 29, 2022. Apart from that, the couple also owns two dogs, and the meteorologist is a pet lover, as she has brought her pet to a station a few times.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Take a look at this:&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Where Is Marty Walsh Going After Leaving Biden Administration?

She hasn’t talked about her weight loss, but we can see her body has changed after giving birth to her daughter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Waldref must have followed diet plans as she has loos a hefty amount of weight in the past few months. Exploring her past images, we can clearly see a massive difference in her appearance.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/278998459_288669300089575_3598888751422441703_n.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Due to changes, people have also said that she has gone through weight loss. Despite all the rumors about her weight loss, Waldref has not said anything about her weight. We believe she also prioritizes her health, just like het professional career.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Additionally, we can follow her on Instagram under the username&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>@waldrefweather</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, where she often posts her daily pictures.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiflaO2tr%2FCnqOemqNjsLC5jrCfnqqVYra0edKtnKmgkaO2pnnWmqOdqpWbeqi7yKeeZpmWqbKzecuemK%2Bhnpx6rLvLnWY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./7-days-movie-review-2022.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="7 Days movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2022)">&larr;
