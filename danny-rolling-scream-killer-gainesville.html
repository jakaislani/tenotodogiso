He also recalled these early years as a time when he developed multiple personalities as a "defense" from the nightmarish reality around him, with attempts at suicide failing to bring an escape.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">He began a cycle of armed robberies and incarceration</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kicked out of the Air Force in 1972 after getting busted for drug possession, Rolling went to live with his grandfather and, for a time, found some stability through his church. He married a woman named O'Mather Halko, with whom he had a daughter, but eventually, he drove her away after exacting the same sort of abuse on her that had been prevalent in his own childhood home.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Already harboring a habit for voyeurism and plagued by disturbing visions, Rolling took a turn for the worse after the divorce. He raped a woman who resembled his ex-wife and embarked on several armed robberies through the South, leading to his incarceration in Jackson, Georgia, in 1979.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The 1980s brought more of the same for Rolling, who was in and out of jail in Alabama and Mississippi for armed robbery. His time in between stints in jail were spent traveling the country, stealing and occasionally forcing himself on women.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Back in Shreveport in November 1989, Rolling was fired from his job at a restaurant. That same night, he broke into a home to murder 24-year-old Julie Grissom, her eight-year-old nephew, Sean, and her 55-year-old father, Tom. Echoing his later killings, Julie was found with bite marks and her body arranged with her legs spread on the bed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The following May, Rolling got into one final argument with his father. This time he pulled out a gun and shot James in the stomach and head. His father survived but lost the use of an eye and ear before fleeing to Kansas and Florida, eventually arriving in Gainesville.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">He brutally killed five students in Gainesville</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1990, he set up a campsite in a wooded area behind the University of Florida, Rolling embarked on his murder spree as students began the fall semester.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On August 24, he slipped into the home of UF freshmen Christina Powell and Sonja Larson and brutally stabbed and raped both students. The following day, he made Santa Fe Community College student Christa Hoyt his next victim, leaving behind her severed head on a shelf to face her body propped up on the bed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On August 27, the killer surfaced again at the home of two 23-year-old UF students, Manuel Toboada and Tracy Paules. A former high school football player, Toboada put up a fight before both were overwhelmed; neither body was mutilated this time.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Rolling was charged for the murders almost two years after they happened</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As Rolling skipped town, a local task force was assembled to calm a frantic community and find answers. Authorities soon zeroed in on a prime suspect, a UF student who briefly lived in the same complex as two of the victims and exhibited erratic behavior, at one point getting arrested for hitting his grandmother. It was soon revealed that this student was battling acute manic depression, however, and with zero evidence connecting him to the murders, the task force was back to the drawing board.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Meanwhile, the killer they were looking for was already in jail. In September, Rolling had robbed a Winn-Dixie grocery at gunpoint in Ocala, Florida, and was nabbed after crashing the getaway car. It wasn't until early next year, when authorities used a tooth extracted from Rolling to link him to the DNA evidence at the Gainesville crime scenes, that he became a primary suspect.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Already facing multiple life sentences for his various armed robberies, Rolling was formally charged with the murders of the five Gainesville students in June 1992.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">He claimed to have been driven by an alternate personality named 'Gemini'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around this time, Rolling began corresponding with journalist Sondra London, who would become his fiancée and help him put together The Making of a Serial Killer. And while he had pleaded not guilty, he used fellow inmate Bobby Lewis as his "mouthpiece" to confess to the murders.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In February 1994, just before the start of his trial, Rolling abruptly changed his plea to guilty. To determine the sentence, jurors listened to testimony from his mother, who recounted the abuse the defendant had received at the hands of his father, and from a psychiatrist, who described an alternate personality of Rolling's named "Gemini," who drove him to his sadistic acts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Two other psychiatrists also testified that a severe personality disorder was in play, but stated their belief that Rolling understood the magnitude of his crimes. The jury unanimously found Rolling guilty of first-degree murder on all five counts in late March, and a month later he was sentenced to death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His appeals exhausted, Rolling faced execution at Florida State Prison on October 25, 2006. In his final moments, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.gainesville.com/article/LK/20061026/News/604169997/GS/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he regaled" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he regaled</a> the 47 people crammed into the witness room with one of his songs, a religious hymn with the refrain "none greater than thee, O Lord, none greater than thee." His microphone was then cut off, ending a life story as twisted as any that could appear on the big screen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiaq6Gdmnylrc2nsGaqn6G5qrrGZqqcqpWWum63yKWjnqpdnK6qusSsraKknJo%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-ruby-wax-illness-and-health-update.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Ruby Wax?
