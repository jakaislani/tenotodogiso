She has said countless times that she would not be described by her race, but acknowledging her roots is inevitable.&nbsp;She is biracial because her father is African American and her mother is American.</span></p><p><span>Their pedagogical details have not been made available yet.&nbsp;An update would come once she’s ready to talk about it.&nbsp;The young tennis lover turned professional at the age of 14, she had perfected her skills through practice and at 17 she was in the top 100 in the 2013 Women’s Tennis Association Rankings.</span></p><p><span>The tennis player is one of the top servers in The Young Women’s Tennis Game and one of the few top-ranked players on the Women Tennis Association Tour.&nbsp;She’s been the talk of tennis lovers since becoming one of the first Americans to make the game’s top ten since the fearless Serena Williams broke the records seventeen years ago.</span></p><p><span>The young tennis player was also ranked as one of the best next-generation tennis players, having reached the ranks of Sloane Stephens and Coco Vandeweghe.&nbsp;She became the crème de la crème after winning the match with Stephen Sloane in the 2017 US Open final that allowed her to play in the quarterfinals of the Grand Slam tournament that same year.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><strong><span>career</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Madison Keys first fell in love with tennis at the age of four while watching The Championships at Wimbledon,&nbsp;</span><span>the</span><span>&nbsp;world’s oldest tennis tournament.&nbsp;Aspiring to be like Venus Williams, she politely asked her parents for her own white tennis dress.</span></p><p><span>Her first step in perfecting her skills was her habit of playing randomly among her peers, but she joined the&nbsp;</span><span>Quad-City tennis club</span><span>&nbsp;at seven, where she continued to hone her skills and began competing at nine.&nbsp;As she got older, she moved to Florida with her mother and siblings and learned at&nbsp;</span><span>Evert Tennis Academy</span><span>&nbsp;at ten.</span></p><p><span>Madison Keys made an impressive showing in the&nbsp;</span><span>Ponte Vedra Beach Championship,</span><span>&nbsp;losing only one game in 2009.&nbsp;The following year, the young star matched her outstanding skills and certified her for the United States Open Tennis Championship, which also earned her the ITF Women’s Circuit.&nbsp;She was one of the youngest seven to win the Women’s Tennis Federation tour-level match after defeating Alla Kudryavtseva for the title.</span></p><p><span>The pro-la tennis star def. Serena Williams, the legendary tennis player who is ranked No. 2 in the women’s game in five games and earned a wild card to the Miami Open.&nbsp;She held her head high and defeated Jill Craybas in the Grand Slam tournament.&nbsp;At 16, she was the youngest to ever make it.</span></p><p><span>Keys became the first runner-up in the Charleston Cup, where she lost to Kerber Angelique, continuing her pace and consistently being in the top fifty throughout 2014 but finishing the year ranked No. 31 in the world.</span></p><p><span>Aside from beating Williams, she also acted relentlessly with some of the renowned tennis pros in the game and was ranked No. 16 in the world after being eliminated in the 4th round of the US Open on May 18, 2015.&nbsp;In 2016, Madison Keys had a career lift;&nbsp;She was number 7 in the world.&nbsp;She got her share of game pain after injuring her wrist, this delayed some of her games, but she has continued to make her name.</span></p><p><span>Aside from tennis, the young star loves baking, watching soccer and basketball games and has also found solace in music and reading.&nbsp;She has dedicated her time as an ambassador for the Fearlessly Girl organization.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-parents-siblings></span><strong><span>Family (parents & siblings)</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Her father never played tennis, however, he played basketball for Division III All-American College at Augustana College.&nbsp;His name is Rick Keys and her mother is Christine.&nbsp;Both work as lawyers and have been blessed with four girls;&nbsp;Madison is the second child.&nbsp;Madison Keys has an older sister named Sydney and two other sisters named Montana and Hunter.&nbsp;More details about her parents have been released on social media.&nbsp;However, they are always present in their daughter’s games and have been her biggest fan.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-her-boyfriend></span><strong><span>who is her boyfriend</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Madison Keys is one of the few who prefers to talk about her career rather than her personal love life, many of her fans have assumed that she is bisexual, particularly through her involvement in the LGBT community.</span></p><p><span>There are records of her relationship with tennis player Björn Fratangelo.&nbsp;Their relationship became an open core when they were first spotted together in 2017.</span><br><span>Given her love interests, Keys has also been linked to being involved with Nick Kyrgios, however there is no certainty that this was ever the case.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height></span><strong><span>Height</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Madison Keys has an athletic build and is 5ft 10 inches tall, weighs 66kg, which could be considered perfect physique when calculating Body Mass Index.&nbsp;She measures 27-37-38 for her waist, bra and hip size.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWRmba0u81mop6xo2KvqruMqZirnZ6pwG6ywKagpbFdqLajuMinnqxllam1r7XCoquyZZantqa6w2afnqGXncFw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rebecca-keatley-wiki-everything-to-know-about-the-cbeebies-presenter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rebecca Keatley Wiki: Everything To Know About The CBeebies Presenter">&larr;
