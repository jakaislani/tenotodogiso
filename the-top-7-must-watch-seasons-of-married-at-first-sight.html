Although as you may guess, when two strangers meet for the first time at the altar, sparks are bound to fly, and in more ways than one. Married at First Sight has seen it all — love, loss, betrayal, and even, against the odds, some success.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=982 data-current-count=982 data-injectable=true>The “modern-day matchmaking” experiment features a panel of experts who pair the prospective couples based on an array of compatibility factors, hoping to create lifelong partnerships. The show began all the way back in 2014 with three couples in the bustling city of New York. As the show progressed, the number of couples expanded, as did the process. The current day show pairs five potential couples, so ten hopeful singles in all, and has been in thirteen cities and counting. As the show<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> releases its 17th season</a> bound for Denver, and reveals rumors of an 18th being filmed in Chicago, we can’t help but look back on some of the best (and worst) Married at First Sight moments. From the “aww” to the “awful,” there are some seasons that really took us on a ride. So join us for a trip down memory lane as we recap the 10 must-watch Married at First Sight seasons that caught both the headlines and let’s be real — our hearts.</p><h2 id=h-season-11-new-orleans data-injectable=false>Season 11 – New Orleans</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MAFS-S11-Couples_Bennett-Amelia-1.jpg><p data-characters=591 data-current-count=891 data-injectable=true>Season 11 is undoubtedly the most unique of all the MAFS seasons. Why? Because it happens to land right smack in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. The entire production had to be shut down mid-season and Decision Day filming was put on hold, meaning the couples were quarantined together —indefinitely! The couples had to pick up where the film crews left off by videoing their own journey via home-video-style cameras. They ended up staying quarantined for 10 whole weeks, making the show last a total of 16 weeks, as opposed to the usual 8. It is the longest season of MAFS to date.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>On Decision Day, three couples said “yes” and two have remained together currently. In fact, one of the fan-favorite couples — Amani and Woody Randall — just welcomed their first child together, a son named Reigh. This season is a must-watch for its unique home video style filming and intense pandemic conditions.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Season 1 – New York</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/jamie-and-doug-season-1-e1662151278305.jpg><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>An oldie but a goodie, and let’s be honest, it’s hard to beat an original! Season 1 took place in New York City, and marked the first time we watched three couples meet as strangers at the altar. The season started off with two couples having their dream wedding, and one couple living their nightmare. For Season 1’s Jamie Otis, walking down the aisle and seeing her future husband Doug Hehner was a far cry from love at first sight. Literally, Jamie actually left the wedding in tears.</p><p data-characters=634 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>Yet in a turn of events that made fans believe in Married at First Sight fairytales, Jamie and Doug fell head over heels for each other. While all three couples said “yes” on Decision Day, Jamie and Doug are the last remaining original and longest-running Married at First Sight couple. With almost a decade of marriage and two children under their belt, they still are a fan favorite. The couple seemed to prove that with persistence, determination, and a little bit of luck, the Married at First Sight process can actually work. For this reason (and many more) Married at First Sight season 1 makes our must-watch list.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Season 9 – Charlotte</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/deonna-and-greg-2.jpg><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>The 9th Season of MAFS brought controversy, chaos, and some really cute couples, which is exactly why it made it on our top 10 list. Besides, what’s MAFS without a little drama? Season 9 garnered a lot of attention mainly because of one of the most mismatched couples MAFS has seen, and we don’t just mean their height.</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>Matt Gwynne and Amber Bowles were almost two feet apart in height, and even farther apart in their goals. Amber wanted a settled, long-term commitment, while it seemed like all Matt wanted was a platform of fame to further his dwindling basketball career and romantic prospects. Only one short week after getting married Matt stayed out all night, within two weeks the wedding band was off, and within three … well, we will let you watch and see.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>Also, fellow couples Beth and Jamie and costars Deonna and Greg Okotie were two of the longest-running couples of MAFS. Beth and Jamie, unfortunately, recently parted ways, yet Deonna and Greg have their hands full with their now almost-toddler son, Declan. The drama, the intrigue, and these long-lasting couples are why this season made our must-watch list.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Season 8 – Philadelphia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MAFS-Couples-kristine-e1662151363739.jpg><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>While MAFS‘s season 8 might have ended with only two couples intact, they were two of fans’ (and our) favorites. Season 8 was filmed in Philadelphia, and introduced us to Stephanie “Philly Steph,” Aj Vollmoeller, and Kristine and Keith Dewar. These couples went through a few ups and downs, but nothing compared to their co-stars, the infamous Kate and Luke Cuccurullo.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=true>Luke’s gaslighting ways consistently land him spots on MAFS‘s “worst husbands lists” and stole a lot of the spotlight during the season. Although the real highlight of the season — we have to say — was the champagne flute-shaped hot tub that Kristine and Keith escaped to during the especially chaotic couples’ retreat episode.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Other than that, watching Aj and Steph fall in love is really one of the highlights of this season. The two couples are still together and going strong, and are often featured as two of MAFS‘s most successful couples. We could say that it was the cute couples — or the drama — that sold us on this season, but let’s be real, it was the champagne flute-shaped hot tub that did it.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Season 6 – Boston</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MAFS-Couples-jephte-e1662151389486.jpg><p data-characters=627 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>Season 6 took us to Beantown to meet some seriously cute (and chaotic) couples. Shawniece and Jephte Pierce were the fan favorites right from the start, and stayed that way as the couples around them slowly but surely began to sink. Ryan Buckley’s party-boy ways did not win him any favor with fans or his wife, Jaclyn Schwartzberg, and as for fellow couple Molly Duff and Jonathan Francetic – well, that’s a whole other story. The couple’s marriage culminated in an explosive blowup that was caught on John’s phone camera. It got pretty ugly. The two ultimately parted ways before the season ended.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>Meanwhile, Shawniece and Jephte sailed through the season to Decision Day and beyond, and are now the proud parents of a little girl they named Laura. In fact, not only did the process work for Jephte, but it also worked for his friend Olejawan, who found his wife Katina in season 14, which also made our list.</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=761 data-injectable=true>Yet the far more scandalous connection this season made was between the jilted John and — the show’s (former) expert, Dr. Jessica Griffin! In an unprecedented MAFS first, an expert matched herself! It was quite the scandal and obviously, Dr. Griffin was not asked to return to the show. She and John subsequently got married and are still together and going strong. So does that count as one of the longest-running MAFS couples? We say yes!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Season 13- Houston</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/michaela.jpg><p data-characters=558 data-current-count=858 data-injectable=true>Everything is bigger in Texas — including the drama! The couples in this season seemed to be some of the more mismatched of the group, which means sparks definitely flew. Michaela Clark and Zach Freeman, although initially thought to be one of the most-likely-to-succeed couples, found themselves parting ways — for the first of many times — right after the honeymoon. Then in the midst of a huge blowup on the couples retreat, Michaela is actually caught on camera having multiple meltdowns and even destroying things in the AirBnb! Talk about chaos.</p><p data-characters=648 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>In yet another Texas-sized scandal, hubby Ryan Ignasiak found himself back on dating apps before he was even divorced! It was discovered during the show’s filming that he had put himself back on the market as single, while still supposedly trying to make things work with his then-wife Brett Layton. Talk about scandalous. Obviously, the pair parted ways, along with several of the other couples. Although two said yes on Decision Day, they have since parted ways, making the Houston current couple count — zero. Yet despite the disappointing outcome, the season still features some high and low moments that are definitely worth watching.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Season 10 – Washington D.C.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MAFS-10-Jessica-Austin-1-e1662151413828.jpg><p data-characters=534 data-current-count=834 data-injectable=true>MAFS season 10 featured one of the most successful couples and not one, but two of the most trainwreck couples in MAFS history, which is what made us put it on our must-watch list, because who doesn’t love a good polarity? Jessica and Austin Studer were not just MAFS sweethearts but America’s sweethearts. Their quirky ways and instant connection won fans’ hearts almost immediately. They sailed through the season and have been together ever since. They just welcomed their first child, a little boy named Weston.</p><p data-characters=638 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true>Meanwhile, on the other side of love, there were Brandon and Taylor. These two were drama with a capital D. The two fought battles in person and over social media, all culminating in Brandon leaving and refusing to be filmed. In a MAFS first (and so far only), Brandon and Taylor were granted an annulment of their marriage. In another MAFS first, even though the cameras stopped rolling on these two, the drama didn’t. The divorced duo were arrested and taken to jail over a bar fight which resulted in matching restraining orders. This secret was exposed during the season reunion, and it was not exactly a proud moment for MAFS.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>While that is more than enough drama for one season, apparently some on the show thought it wasn’t. Another pair ended things after the groom was found to be having a fling with his wife’s friend and bridesmaid at their wedding! Ick. Check it out for yourself, seriously this season is a must-watch.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Season 14-Boston( Again)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mark-and-lindsey.jpg><p data-characters=724 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>Married at First Sight made a victory lap to Boston, and the drama the second time around was far bigger than the first. Season 14 made history as the only season where a bride tapped out — before the wedding night. Yes, in an MAFS first (and let’s hope only) Alyssa Ellman decided to part ways with her new hubby, Chris Collette, immediately after the wedding. She refused to stay in the same hotel room as him, either on the wedding night or during the honeymoon, and as soon as the pair arrived back in Boston, she proposed taking turns living in the shared apartment. Unsurprisingly, Chris was not exactly on board for that, and the two parted ways. For this couple, the honeymoon was over before it even began.</p><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>While Chris and Alyssa may have initially stolen the show, since their relationship was short-lived, another couple felt the need to pick up the torch. “Mark the Shark” and Lindsey answered the call, as they also had some major blow-ups and breakdowns throughout the show. Yet Boston’s bossy Lindsey didn’t only have rumbles with her hubby; it seemed everyone on the show got a taste of her fire. Almost no episode went by where Lindsey didn’t get into some kind of throwdown.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>The season ended with two pairs saying yes on Decision Day, but ultimately the final couple count came out to zero. The Boston season’s over-the-top accents were matched only by this, its over-the-top drama.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Season 15- San Diego</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/krysten-1.jpeg><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>Season 15 featured the first time MAFS ventured into the land of sea and sunshine — California. San Diego introduced us to some highly unusual duos, and one of the dirtiest bathtubs ever shown on TV. Allow us to explain.</p><p data-characters=587 data-current-count=810 data-injectable=true>The season paired up some very picky partners, including environmentally-conscious Mitch Silverstein, who laid down the environmental law with his new wife, Krysten Collins. Throughout the season we saw his unusual clothing, household, and cleaning choices, including a tour of his bachelor pad with a bathtub that garnered more attention than the couple themselves. It literally became its own meme. Seriously, that thing was like a biohazard. While bachelor bathtubs may not sound like a riveting reason to watch, the major drama that went down between Mitch and Kristen definitely is.</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>Yet Mitch and Krysten weren’t the only ones having a little trouble setting sail to happily ever after. Morgan and her new hubby Binh hit some major snags on their honeymoon that they never quite recovered from, making them one of the first couples to tap out on their marriage and putting them in the top 10 fastest failing marriages on the show. While there were some “yes”-es on Decision Day, unfortunately,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> they did not last.</a></p><p data-characters=98 data-current-count=98 data-injectable=false>The season is too good to pass up, so set your sails toward season 15 and watch the drama unfold.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Season 7 – Dallas</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/tristan-and-mia-2.jpg><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=892 data-injectable=true>You may think this season made our list because of America’s sweethearts, Bobby and Danielle Dodd. While these two are certainly a match made in MAFS heaven, with five years of marriage and three children, we chose this season for yet another MAFS must-watch first. We all know marriage can end not just in heartbreak, but in handcuffs, right? That’s a new one, and season seven was the first — and so far only season — where a member of the couple was arrested during filming.</p><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>Yes, you read that correctly. Mia Bally was arrested while filming the season as she tried to board the plane for her honeymoon with her new husband, Tristan Thompson. Mia spent part of her honeymoon in jail. When she was finally released and details were revealed, the charges against her were for stalking and stealing from her ex. Mia claimed it was simply a case of mistaken identity, which was later proven to be a lie. The couple never fully recovered from their rocky start, and ultimately called it quits following the finale.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>These two were in direct contrast to their costars, Danielle and Bobby Dodd, who literally did not have a single disagreement the entire season. The pair simply, quietly, and happily sailed through their season and Decision Day. The couple is still together today, and have three children.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=false>With 17 seasons and counting, it is hard to pick just a few Married at First Sight favorites. Yet this list certainly is a great jumping-off point to get you in the groove for the new Denver season being released on October 12. Although whichever season you choose, there is one thing that is always certain – two strangers marrying, at first sight, is never dull.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmq6ioXWx6rsHSrWSwmaSYtW6%2FxJqqqKajYrynecyaqauhlZl6osCMn6Crq6RiwKqzx61m</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gary-oldman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gary Oldman Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More">&larr;
