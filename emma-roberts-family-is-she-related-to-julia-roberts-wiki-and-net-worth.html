Julia and Emma Roberts have always spoken great things about one other, and it’s evident that they’ve had a love connection since Emma was a child. Emma was motivated to start acting at the age of eight and was cast in Blow opposite Johnny Depp and Penélope Cruz at the age of nine. In 2001, she also featured as an extra in America’s Sweethearts.</p><p>She came to notoriety after appearing in small parts in films such as Blow (2001) and the Nickelodeon television series Unfabulous (2004-07), for which she won a Teen Choice Award and six Young Artist Awards.</p><h2>Is Emma Roberts Related To Julia Roberts?</h2><p>Emma Roberts is, in fact, connected to Julia Roberts. Roberts is the niece of Academy Award winner Julia Roberts. Emma, on the other hand, has not allowed this to prevent her from carving her own route in the profession. She’s 30 years old and has previously portrayed the charming, lovable nerd in a series of adolescent comedies, shifted to horror in American Horror Story, and perfectly represented life as a single twentysomething in the Netflix rom-com Holidate. It would seem scary to have such a renowned aunt, but Emma stated in a recent Tatler interview that she’s simply “doing her own thing.” Emma said that as a youngster, she learned a lot about the profession by visiting her aunt on set. On occasion, she was even allowed to try on some of the outfits. In a 2020 interview, Emma stated that there are images of her on the set of Erin Brockovich experimenting on Julia Roberts’ movie costumes and posing in the wardrobe trailer.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Emma-Roberts-1.jpg alt="Emma Roberts" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Emma Roberts’s Family</h2><p>Emma Roberts is the niece of Julia Roberts and the daughter of actor Eric Roberts. Julia and Emma have had troubled ties with Eric in the past. Julia even stood by Emma’s mother, Kelly Cunningham, while she fought for custody of Emma after her divorce from Eric. She apparently sponsored Cunningham’s court struggle because she thought her brother Eric, who was suffering from drugs and alcohol at the time, should not have full custody of Emma. Despite the disagreement, Julia and Eric finally reconcile, and Eric can also repair his connection with Emma.</p><p>Julia’s tight bond with her niece, Emma, was a constant throughout this family drama. Emma has talked extensively about her experiences growing up on her renowned aunt’s movie sets and how this motivated her to seek a career in acting.</p><h2>Emma and Julia Roberts’s Net Worth</h2><p>According to wealthygorilla.com, Emma Roberts has a net worth of $25 million.
